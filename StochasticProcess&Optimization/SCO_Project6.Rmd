## Question 2

states = i,j,k   i = our accumulated score
                 j = opponents accumulated score
                 k = current run total

action = R or H (roll or hold)


if p1 is the probability of rolling a 1

V(i,j,k) = max[p1(1-V(j,i+1,0)) + p2 V(i,j,k+2) + p3 V(i,j,k+3) + p4 V(i,j,k+4) + p5 V(i,j,k+5) + p6 V(i,j,k+6),(1- V(j,i+k,0))]     
               
               
terminal equations:

V(i,100,k) = 0 (if opponent reaches 100 points)
V(100,j,k) = 1 (if we reach 100 points)
V(99,j,k) = 1 (if we reach 99 points and it's our turn to roll)
